/** @mainpage Welcome to PARADISEO - Bi-objective flow-shop scheduling problem contribution

@section Introduction

Solving the ﬂow-shop problem consists in scheduling N jobs on M machines. 
Machines are critical resources, i.e. two jobs cannot be assigned to one machine simultaneously.
A job Ji is composed of M consecutive tasks ti1, ti2, ..., tiM, where tij is the jth task of the job Ji, requiring the machine Mj.
A processing time pij is associated to each task tij and a job Ji must be achieved before its due date di.
For the permutation ﬂow-shop, the operating sequences of the jobs are identical and unidirectional on every machines.
Here, we focus on minimizing both the makespan and the total tardiness (T ), which are two of the most studied objectives of the literature.

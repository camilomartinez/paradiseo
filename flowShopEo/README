==========================================================================================

PARADISEO (PARallel and DIStributed Evolving Objects) is a white-box object-oriented
framework dedicated to the flexible design of metaheursitics. This package contains 
many convenient classes to solve a bi-objective flow-shop scheduling problem within ParadisEO-EO and ParadisEO-MOEO.
An example using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is also provided.

              INSTRUCTIONS
==========================================================================================

To install the package, simply follow these steps:

* Edit the "install.cmake" file and replace "myDirectory" by the absolute path to ParadisEO
	=> Example: 
			SET(PARADISEO_DIR "myDirectory" CACHE PATH "ParadisEO directory" FORCE)
		replaced by:
			SET(PARADISEO_DIR "/opt/paradiseo-ix86-1.0" CACHE PATH "ParadisEO directory" FORCE)

* Go in the "build" directory

* Run (in a terminal/console): cmake .. -G"<generator type>"
	(Several generators exist: see http://paradiseo.gforge.inria.fr/index.php?n=Paradiseo.CmakeGenerators)

* Compile using the appropriate tool (run "make" if you choose the "Unix Makefiles" generator)
